Scripts for the automating of some file naming and formatting tasks

## Preconditions

* You should have permissions in your file system to rename files

First enter the string you would like to prepend to the beginning of each file name in the input text box. Then either select "Browse Files" or "Browse Folders". Both options will open up a file explorere where you can chose the file to open. "Browse Folders" will allow you to chose a folder in which all files in that folder will have the string prepended to the name, and "Browse Files" will allow you to chose a singular file to prepend the string to.

**Note**: When usingf the folder mode, be sure to actually click into the folder you want to open before cliking open in the explorer, do not just click teh folder once and then click open or else you will rename all of the files one folder to high.
